                    I like that this article mentions the UI side of game design, and how it interacts with the other features of a game. 
                    Every instance of design where UI is used is immersive in some way. 
                    Video games are sort of the epitome of this, bringing the user into some imagined space or world represented in some degree of realism. 
                    If the controls, menus, or any other interactive element of the game does not flow properly, the user will be yanked from this experience, ruining the immersion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article identifies promoting player engagement as one of the primary goals of game design, and mentions various means of doing this throughout. 
                    Among these are intuitive controls, clear objectives, and rewards for completing some task. 
                    I think the most interesting, however, is simple core mechanics. 
                    I can think of many games where the set of core mechanics is exteremely limited, and leaves it up to the players to combine these mechanics and push them to their limit, eventually approaching and defining the games skill ceiling. 
                    These types of games are incredibly rewarding, especially over the long run, as the player feels incredibly accomplished due to their mastery.

                <p>
                    When a user interacts with a webpage, they generally have some task or goal they want to complete. 
                    As soon as the page loads, the user gains momentum as they navigate and work towards their goal. 
                    Overlays and lightboxes, if properly implemented, can aid the user, providing them with pertinent information and/or fields precisely when they are needed. 
                    They can also abruptly stop the user's movement, which, save for specific cases, is to be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article on overlays by Kathryn Whitenton (linked above) sees overlays and lightboxes as an overused appraoch in web design, stating that too many designers use them for their owen convenience rather than that of their users. 
                    Whitenton goes on to present some questions that designers should ask themselves before implementing overlays. 
                    Perhaps the most enlightening of these is: "when will the overlay appear, and will it be an interruption?" 
                    One of the most irritating scenarios a web user can find themselves in is to be presented with an unwarranted lightbox. 
                    Such scenarios are made worse through repeated instances on the same page. 
                    One solution to this, which ensures that all lightboxes appear at appropriate times, is to think about the information being presented and only present it when the user is likely to be at a point in the workflow where is is necessary to continue. 
                    Better yet would be to only show a lightbox when the user clicks a button requesting the information contained in the overlay. 
                    However, it is also the responsibility of the designer, as Whitenton reminds us, to be absolutely certain that the information would not be more effectively presented by some means other than an overlay.

                <h2><span>Designing HTML Forms</span><span class="article-date">21 January, 2025</span></h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="special-copy">This post discusses <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">this article</a> by Salim Ansari.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's safe to say that users want to spend as little time as possible doing anything online which resembles work. 
                    Therefore, web forms are user-adverse. 
                    They require typing, attention, carefully placed clicks, and perhaps that the user move around so as to gather required information. 
                    This equates to work for the user. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This reveals that forms are transactional. 
                    The user exchanges their time and effort for some outcome achieved upon form completion. 
                    If the effort involved in completing the form is percieved to be too great, then the transaction will appear imbalanced and the user may not complete the form. 
                    As the article mentions, unsubmitted forms means less conversion and lost business for the form's administrator. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus it is the form designer's job to cause more users to complete it. 
                    The article provides many useful insights as to how this may be achieved. 
                    Perhaps the most interesting concept brought up was that of momentum of the user through a form. 
                    Momentum is good and its interruption increases the liklihood that the user abandons prior to completion. 
                    The article identifies form layout as the key driver (or potential disruptor) of momentum, explicitly in regard to the number of columns the form occupies, with more columns interrupting it and one being optimal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that the concept of momentum is under-applied in the article. 
                    For example, the author notes that poorly labeled fields cause users to become confused and look in too many places. 
                    I might add that this is a disruptor to the user's momentum as they have to stop "moving" and actively process information. 
                    I think that this is the essential reason why confusion is bad as to fix confusion momentum is sacrificed. 
                    This does not, however, subtract value from tips the author provides, all of which are very successful in content and communication.
