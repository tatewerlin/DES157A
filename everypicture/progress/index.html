    <p>
        The underlying concept for this project, in it's most distilled form, is to give people the chance to interact with objects they normally ignore in their day to day lives, and to make it fun to do so.
        Most of the feedback I recieved on my <a href="../experiment/index.html" class="goto">experimentation draft</a> of this project had to do with the concept. 
        It was clear to me that I was not communicating it well enough. 
        Instead of communicating this explicitly, I improved the interactivity of the site to communicate it indirectly. 
        I added two 'modes' of interactivity which change how to user interacts with the images (only one is currently functional and I hope to add a third). 
        The page is not really reliant on its styling and most of the work to improve it will be in JavaScript, thus I didn't find creating new sketches necessary. 
        I just wanted to get into the code and make it more fun to use.
